The dante enablement project demostrates the pro audio Dante software
running on TI ARM Cortex-A15 platformsa in loopback mode.

There are 2 types of loopback in the demo:

   1) ARM-only loopback: In this loopback type, audio samples received from
      network will loopback in ARM GPU and out to netowrk.
   2) DSP loopback: In DSP loopback, the audi samples will be offloaded to
      DSP and loopback in DSP back to ARM GPU, then out to network

There are 2 patch files provided:

1) 0001-linux-KConfig-Enable-Dante-required-CGROUP-and-Names.patch

   Dante Enabled Platform (DEP) container requires RT-Linux and 
   CGROUP and Namespace support. Hence, this patch file reflects the
   needed features in RT-Linux kernel which are not included in the 
   default setting. The change is based on kernel 4.19.59 (Linux 
   Processor SDK 06.01 release).

   RT-Linux kernel needs to rebuilt after the patch file is applied.


   a. Apply patch to PLSDK:
      $ cd <plsdk_linux-rt-k2g-installed-dir>/board-support/linux-rt-[version]
      $ patch < 0001-linux-KConfig-Enable-Dante-required-CGROUP-and-Names.patch 

   b. Rebuilt rt-linux

   Add the SDK's toolchain to the PATH environment variable and build the kernel image
      $ export PATH=<sdk path>/linux-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/bin:$PATH
      $ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- tisdk_k2g-evm-rt_defconfig
      $ make -j8 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- zImage
   Copy arch/arm/boot/zImage to the /boot/zImage on K2G SD card

   Please see detailed build instruction in PLSDK Kernel User Guide:
   http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-linux/esd/docs/latest/linux/Foundational_Components_Kernel_Users_Guide.html

2) dante-loopback-dsp.patch

   This patch file is only needed if doing DSP loopback. This patch
   enables the offload of audio samples to DSP, and back to ARM GPU.
   The offload of audio samples allows further processing of audio
   samples in DSP core. The change is based on DEP 0.9 Beta release.

   a. Apply patch on DEP package installed on K2G
      # copy dante-loopback-dsp.patch to /home/root/dep
      # cd /home/root/dep/example
      # patch < -p5 dante-loopback-dsp.patch

   b. Build loopback example for ARM-only
      # cd /home/root/dep/example/audio
      # make clean
      # make

3. Build loopback example with DSP enablement
      # cd /home/root/dep/example/audio
      # make -f Makefile.opcl clean
      # make -f Makefile.opcl
